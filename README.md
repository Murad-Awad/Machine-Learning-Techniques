# Machine Learning Techniques

This project is meant to put coding examples of specific machine learning techniques including basic neural networks music-generating ai, search optimization machine learning, and perhaps a fully optimized machine learning algorithm which uses a specific technique (eg. PAC) based on the conditions under which the user wants to run the program


## Set Up and Running the code
1. Set up scikit learn however you want. Installation instructions here:http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html .
2. Simply compile the code and see the results (installation will change based on the specific examples that are added).
